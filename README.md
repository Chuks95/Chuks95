- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ChukwudiU95
- ðŸ‘€ I am a certified data scientist with a strong engineering background committed to professional development and value creation. I have a certification in Applied Data Science from the Thayer School of Engineering ,Dartmouth College. Over the past 6 months, I have been committed to gaining analytical skills to solve business-related problems using data-driven techniques. I have applied scientific methods to business scenarios, cleaned and prepared data for statistical and machine learning modeling, worked with a variety of analytical algorithms to build models that explained data relationships and predicted potential scenarios, translated data insights into business value, and communicated results to difference audiences.
I have strong proficiency in the use of python as a tool for data cleaning, analysis and visualization.
